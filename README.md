# Hi and welcome to my GitHub 

### My name is Ingimar. 

> I'm currently undergoing my bachelor's studies in Web Development in Copenhagen. I have a passion for everything related to programming.

I'm a professional Multimedia Designer with a focus on Front-end Development. Although these days, I get to indulge myself in the backends due to my current enrollment.

Currently, I'm heading up a new IT development team as part of my responsibilities for Dialogue One, where I work. This involves setting up a production environment and hiring other developers to join our team.

## I'm very confident developing with these technologies and tools:
