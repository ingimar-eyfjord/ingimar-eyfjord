# Hi and welcome to my GitHub 

### My name is Ingimar. 

> I'm currently undergoing my bachelor's studies in Web Development in Copenhagen. I have a passion for everything related to programming.

I have finished a professional degree in Multimedia Design with a focus on Front-end Development, but have been working with Full-stack development for over two years.

Currently, I'm heading up a new IT development team as part of my responsibilities for Dialogue One, where I work. This involves setting up a production environment and hiring other developers to join our team.

## I'm very confident developing with these technologies and tools:
